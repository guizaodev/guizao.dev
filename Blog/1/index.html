                                    <h1>DLC Content</h1>
                                    <img src="images/DLCs.png" style="align-self:center"/>
                                    <p style="text-align: left">With the release of Minecraft Dungeons came the instant promise of more content further down the line for those who enjoy the game and are willing to spend more money on it, these DLCs are 'Jungle Awakens' and 'Creeping Winter'. Even before the release of v1.1.2.0 it appears both DLCs for the most part were already done and ready to be put into the game.</p>
                                    <h1>Dingy Jungle</h1><img src="images/LS_DingyJungle.png" style="align-self:center"/>
                                    <p style="text-align: left">For the first DLC 'Jungle Awakens' one of the maps currently in the files is 'Dingy Jungle' which states the following: "We've tracked the Orb's shard to the edge of a dense jungle where dangerous creatures creep out from under the thick canopy. What brave hero would dare cut through the twisting vines to reach the dark power that hides within?"<br><br>right away the loading screen features a few mobs we have yet to see in Minecraft Dungeons, these being the Ocelot pet, the Whisperer mob, and the Mossy Skeleton.</p>
                                    <img src="images/Whisperer.png" style="align-self:center" width="10%" height="10%"/><p style="text-align: left">The Whisperer mob has a few currently known attacks.<br>A few Melee Attacks, using its arms to hit the player<br>Summon Blockage: Summons simple obstacles to block the players path<br>Summon Quick-Growing Vines: These vines try to hit the player<br>Summon Poison-Quill Vines attack: These vines shoot poisonous quills at the player from a distance.</p>
                                    <h1>Overgrown Temple</h1><img src="images/LS_overgrownTemple.png"style="align-self:center"/>
                                    <p style="text-align: left">The second map loading screen for the 'Jungle Awakens' DLC is the 'Overgrown Temple' which states the following: "Deep within the jungle lies an overgrown temple, a place where nature has reclaimed its rightful place as ruler of the land. Could the shard have landed here?"<br><br>This loading screen has less sneak peeks of what to expect in the Jungle Awakens DLC mob-wise however it does feature the Jungle Zombie, acting just like a normal zombie but with a little more moss around him.</p>
                                    <h1>Frozen Fjord</h1><img src="images/LS_FrozenFjord.png"style="align-self:center"/>
                                    <p style="text-align: left">As we step away from the tropical forst that is 'Jungle Awakens' we make our way to the second DLC which has yet to be publicly announced titled 'Creeping Winter'. The first loading screen is for the Frozen Fjord and states "To reach the source of the creeping winter, we must journey into the deep reaches of the wintry wilderness, with only a frozen river as our guide. Icy paths and dangerous enemies attack through the wind and snow, but the distant sight of a lone fortress could serve as a sanctuary from the elements."<br><br>This loading screen features quite the cast of new mobs such as the Frozen Zombie, Icy Creeper, Chillager, and the Polar Bear.</p>
                                    <img src="images/Chillager.png" style="align-self:center" width="10%" height="10%"/><p style="text-align: left">The Chillager appears to be an earlier version in the loading screen as the official version rocks a blue robe instead of a purple one. According to the Minecraft Dungeons Wiki, The Chillager will wander around until is sees a player. It will then summon some Ice Blocks above that hover for a few seconds before falling. The ice blocks will stay directly above the player until it drops. The ice blocks can stun the player for several seconds and will apply a slowness effect for another 5 seconds.</p>
                                    <h1>Lone Fortress</h1><img src="images/LS_LoneFortress.png"style="align-self:center"/>
                                    <p style="text-align: left">The second loading screen apart of the 'Creeping Winter' DLC is the 'Lone Fortress' which is "An isolated fortress seems to be the source of the never-ending winter. Worst of all, from somewhere deep within those lonely ramparts, something terrible screams out with rage and fury. We have to push forward through snow-covered hallways and collapsing towers to reach the heart of the storm."<br><br>This loading screen really doesn't like to hint at new mobs as it simply features some of the structural builds for the Lone Fortress that we will be exploring when the DLC comes out.</p>
